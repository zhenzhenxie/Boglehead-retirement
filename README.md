I'm analyzing the spy data and bond (tlt) data from the past to find a safe withdraw rate. 

I'm following this research paper and see what results I will get https://robberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retailinvestor.org_pdf_Bengen1.pdf

Stocks/bond ratio of 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75, 0/100 will be analyzed.
